# Telecom-Industry-User-Analytics
The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia. The goal of this project is to provide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  We will do this by analysing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers &amp; their activities on the network.
